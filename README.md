- Examine the content of the repo (or, just blindly trust me!)

- Then, clone the repo as a folder (directory -- we use both linux and win terms interchangeably) 
    - that is on the $PATH.
        - For exaample: $HOME/bin , 
            - which often is already set on the PATH in .profile.

- Then, you can enjoy those tiny tools.
    - Note that they are self-documenting -- which is very important.  

- A related note: when use ssh to push/pull from github, the git URL:
    - Git protocol  (i.e. git@xxxxxxxx) uses ":"  
    - Https protocl (i.e. https://xxxx) uses "/"
